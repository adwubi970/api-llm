AI Risk Classification Pipeline (Ollama + Web Scraping)

This project is a Python-based pipeline that:

Scrapes descriptive text from public web pages

Sends the text to a local Ollama LLM

Classifies whether the system uses AI

Assigns a risk level and key AI-related risks

Stores the results in a structured CSV dataset

It is designed as a lightweight AI risk assessment demo for research, coursework, or experimentation with local LLMs.
