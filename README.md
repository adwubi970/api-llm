AI Risk Classification Pipeline (Ollama + Web Scraping)

-This project is a Python-based pipeline that:

1)Scrapes descriptive text from public web pages
2)Sends the text to a local Ollama LLM
3)Classifies whether the system uses AI
4)Assigns a risk level and key AI-related risks
5)Stores the results in a structured CSV dataset
6)It is designed as a lightweight AI risk assessment demo for research, coursework, or experimentation with local LLMs.
